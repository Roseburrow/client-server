# client-server
Uni project to make a simple client and server. It uses a database of people with locations attached to them.
Input to the client is done through running the client program with arguements.

To make a request either type a name into the client like this:
samuel
to get that persons location (if they exist) or type a name and a location like this:
samuel "in a meeting"
to change samuels location to be "in a meeting".

If samuel was not in the database using the same method to change his location would add him instead.
